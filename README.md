  ├── components/           # Tool-specific components
  ├── api/                  # Tool-specific API endpoints (if needed)
  └── README.md            # Tool documentation (optional)
  ```

#### Component Organization
- **Shared components** go in `src/lib/components/`
- **Tool-specific components** go in `toolkit/[tool-name]/components/`
- **Shared utilities and stores** go in `src/lib/`

#### Production Cleanup
- **Always document** that tools are in the `toolkit/` folder for easy removal
- **Update the main README** when adding new tools
- **Ensure the toolkit folder can be safely removed** without breaking the main application

This structure ensures easy production deployment by simply removing the `toolkit/` folder.
